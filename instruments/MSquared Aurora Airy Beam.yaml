  notes: "Light-sheet fluorescence microscope using Airy-beam illumination for long-term volumetric live imaging with reduced photobleaching and striping artefacts. Approximate performance claims: up to 600 µm FOV at 20x detection (about 20x Gaussian and 8x Bessel10), sub-1 µm axial resolution, and lower phototoxic burden due to single exposure per z-slice and self-healing/non-diffractive beam propagation."

  XY tiling jobs showed 1-2 frame overlap mismatch near the right edge,
  consistent with increasing stage backlash.

action: "align"
action_details: >
  Re-homed stage axes, tightened X-axis coupling set screw,
  recalibrated pixel size/step conversion in acquisition software,
  and validated with a 6x6 tile phantom run.
